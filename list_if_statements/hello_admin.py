# . Hello Admin: Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name
# 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
# after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
# each user:
# •	 If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
# would you like to see a status report?
# •	 Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

#usernames = ['admin', 'cesar', 'porta', 'nicoll', 'julio']
usernames = []
if  usernames: #adding this line to check if the list is empty
    for username in usernames:
        if 'admin' in username:
            print(f'hello, {username}. would you like to see a status report?')
        else:
            print(f'hello {username}. thank you for logging in again')
else:
    print('we need to find some users!')

# No Users: Add an if test to hello_admin.py to make sure the list of users is
# not empty.
# •	 If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!
# •	 Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct
# message is printed.
